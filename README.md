# TinyApp Project

TinyApp is a full stack web application built with Node and Express that allows users to shorten long URLs (Ã  la bit.ly).
This particular version of TinyApp has a bit of personal flair, featuring the character "Banri Settsu" (A3!) and his role as "Arata Shinbashi".
Images and links are from the [A3! Wiki](https://yaycupcake.com/a3/index.php?title=Banri_Settsu#tab=Gallery).
(Just for fun, [here's the link to the song featured as a link in the final product!](https://open.spotify.com/album/2nI5tm6ft3HO3atBMIZLea?si=0vMU_AFQQyKefbld58qcAw))
